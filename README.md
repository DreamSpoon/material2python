# material2python
Blender addon that makes a Python text-block from current Material node tree.
To use Material 2 Python, look material Shader view, Tool menu, Mat2Python.
Using this function will save shader node type, node location (for clean looking setups), and links between nodes.
The info is saved to a text-block (find this in Blender's Text Editor) with name beginning with: m2pText
Other info, such as default values and color ramp settings, are not captured by this addon.
This addon may evolve as time goes by to include more info.
